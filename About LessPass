About LessPass

For us at LessPass, we believe that a highly effective password security management system should be both simple to use and easy to access.

We know how incredibly frustrating it can be to have to install most password managers out there on all your devices, and sync all these devices

together in order to gain access to your account information at any point in time.
That is why LessPass was created primarily to bypass such unpleasant scenarios such as multiple installations, password data storage on encrypted files, 

while making such information always available to the user via the use of any device, using any simple internet connection and a web browser.

Best of all, it is absolutely free to use.

It is also an open source software.

We therefore invite any interested, talented or skilled users out there to check out the source code here at our GitHub repository.

Please feel free to either suggest improvements, contribute code changes, documents and other valuable contributions to improve 
the application as well.
